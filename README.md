# inkplate-todo
A todo list for the Inkplate 6 Color


## To Do
- Replace all Powershell scripts with Python scripts (cross platform, easier to read/write/maintain)
- Get to do items from clickup API
    - Render nicely
    - Ability to re-fetch (using touchpad press?)
    - Ability to mark item done?
    - Make them look pretty
- Show battery percentage on screen
- API endpoint on Inkplate to fetch battery percentage and other stats (uptime?) to show in Grafana dashboard? (would hurt lifetime of battery though)
- View current config on Inkplate (toggle view via touchpads?)
- View debug logs on Inkplate
